For therapy held remotely, if it works for the child, Shawn will work one-on-one with the child using online exercises and video conferencing. Shawn will also meet with you, to help you help them. All you need is a computer equipped with a microphone and video camera, and an internet connection. We'll find a video conferencing program that works for you at no cost.
