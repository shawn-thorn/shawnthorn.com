      <h1>The Therapy Process</h1>
      
      <p>Shawn will primarily work one-on-one with the child at your home using various techniques such as art therapy, social play, games, role play, positive reinforcement, visual charts, and many others. Occasionally, he will also meet with the family as a whole, as well as help the child adapt to outside environments such as grocery stores or restaurants via excursions.</p>
<p>Although Shawn's focus is behaviour and cognition, his holistic approach covers all areas of a child's development. This means he may carefully assemble a team of specialists such as tutors, speech pathologists, etc. whenever the child would benefit most from these resources. He remains in regular contact with the team to ensure your child is receiving the best help, by observing the child's classroom, home environment, present specialists, etc.</p>

<p>Therapy at home also allows parents to work on therapeutic goals with materials available at home. Beyond the therapeutic benefits, therapy at home provides parents the convenience of having one less appointment to drive their child to and more time to spend with their child.</p>

        <p class="hero-lead" style="margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">
          <p>Shawn started working with my 4 year-old son 5 years ago, who has ASD. Shawn established a rapport and an engaging relationship with him within a few sessions. Shawn coaches our son in areas that are challenging for him: specifically, social and contextual language skills; adaptability to changes; capability to stay on required agenda; and general developmental abilities.</p>
<p>Our family (including our son's grandparents), his nanny and his teacher in school have observed significant improvements in various areas within the short 5 months. They were excited to &ldquo;report&rdquo; our son's openness and communication initiatives to me. Shawn takes a holistic approach in his work with our son and has become part of our family while maintaining his professionalism. He constantly thinks of ways to help our son and incorporates members of our family, teachers, and therapists in his approach so that our son has a consistently conducive environment in overcoming his challenges. In addition, Shawn exposes our son to everyday life situations with a firm and encouraging attitude so that our son is pushed appropriately to his learning potential with trust in &ldquo;Shawn's way&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Our family is very fortunate to have Shawn on board in helping our son's development and we look forward to more positive changes.</p>

          <p>Our son was diagnosed with ASD and (PDD-NOS) at aged 2 and a half years old. Our son began showing more signs of autism and displayed challenging behaviours that were too difficult for us to handle.</p>
<p>We had hired several specialist that have worked with us over a period of 8 months,</p>
<p>However, it is Shawn who has changed our lives. His outstanding skill at dealing with children who have special needs is like nothing I have seen before. He has been able to achieve with our son what no other specialist has. Through constructive play, patience and innovative ideas, Our son has made progress in all areas,  allowing Shawn to teach him different activities and develop the skills to bring him to age appropriate.</p>
<p>After 2 weeks of working with Shawn, our son ran to the window and waited for Shawn's car to pull up. He then ran to the door, took Shawn's hand and pulled him downstairs to the therapy room without giving me a backward glance.</p>
<p>Shawn truly has a unique way in bringing out the best in children, all children. We have come to rely upon Shawn for helping us with our son in all aspects of day to day living with a child that has autism. His methods and common sense make life so much easier for all of us and we value him as a person as well as a professional in this field.</p>

He tends to work with those who suffer from mental illness over those who are just looking for a help; he understands his abilities can help those who need it most. Over the 6 years I've known him, he has helped me with all social and academic issues that have come my way.</p>

Not only have I been getting straight A's, but I am now more comfortable around people and whenever there is problem at school, I know I can share with him and get good advice. Shawn is joy to be mentored by and whenever my mother or father wants me to work on something a little bit or, academically or behaviour wise, he is always there to help me to improve. Shawn has done a lot for me and I dearly thank him for everything.</p>

        <p class="hero-lead" style="margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">
          <p>Shawn began by assisting our, then 9-year-old son, who was displaying academic and behavioural challenges. Shawn implemented therapy and methods that helped our son progress rapidly during the first month. His teachers, peers and other family members noticed the change almost immediately. Our son's confidence skyrocketed and he was able to absorb new information willingly. His confidence, self-independence, and self-worth strengthened. It took less than a couple of months before our son no longer thought of himself as &ldquo;the dumb one&rdquo; amongst his peers.</p>
<p>Thanks to Shawn's dedication, our son, now 16, is now attending one of the most prestigious schools, where he was one of a few who were selected out of hundreds. This accomplishment was due to his academic success, and his strong confidence to take on any task.</p>
<p>Shawn's extensive background in family relations helped counsel and guide our family through several personal crises. He provided a pro-active approach to problem solving with the family as a whole.</p>
<p>Shawn isn't just our family specialist, he's now a member of our family.</p>

Shawn has done an excellent job of creating a positive environment where our son can feel safe and continue to flourish.  Shawn has been tremendous and our child loves being around him. It's been nothing short of positive for us.
Thank you, immensely!</p>
